\section{Introduction}
	We Cerebero are working together with eCivix to create a new web based game. The idea of the game is to create an election simulator to teach High school students how elections work and what their vote essentially means in the greater scheme. The user will create party that they will control. The game will revolve around the party gaining funds and man power to do campaigns and gain more funds and man power to run bigger and more effective campaigns. The user with the score at the end of the game wins. The user will be playing against an AI (Artificial Intelligence) player that we will program. The AI will try be more effective/ more successful than the user. There will be a leader-board with all the users' scores and at the end of the client's event a winner will be chosen for a prize.
