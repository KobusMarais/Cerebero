  \section{Architectural Specifications}
   [Describe architectural specifications of System as well as quality requirements.]
   \subsection{Architectural Requirements}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item (Given to us by the client: eCivix)
        \item Web-based
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The web-based game should be interacted with by users through the web.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Performance
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game must be optimised to function and calculate each decision made by the user in the fastest possible way.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Privacy 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Legally speaking all information captured by the web-based games registration and login process has to be POPI compliant. The team will be assisted by the legal team of eCivix to ensure that all requirements in terms of privacy are met. 
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Security
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This project will need to be able to keep user data secure and prevent illicit access by third parties. 
            Scalability 
            The project is intended for use as an online service, with potentially many different types of gameplay and playthroughs. The project should scale as the size of the game itself grows. 

	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Enjoyment
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The project should have adequate user enjoyment features as well as a fun and interactive GUI which is obviously playable as well as usable. 
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Game Theory 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The end game should include mathematical models that simulate the conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision-makers to showcase and represent behavioural patterns of South African voters. In addition, AI players should employ game theory to determine their optimal course of action in any given circumstance.
	    \end{itemize}
   
   \end{itemize}
   \subsection{Quality Requirements} 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Robustness
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game should have the ability to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Maintainability
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game should be easily maintainable (in good condition), to make future maintenance easier.
         \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
