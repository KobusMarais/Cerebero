 \section{Introduction}
	We Cerebero are working together with eCivix to create a new web based game. The idea of the game is to create an election simulator to teach High school students how elections work and what their vote essentially means in the greater scheme. The user will create party that they will control. The game will revolve around the party gaining funds and man power to do campaigns and gain more funds and man power to run bigger and more effective campaigns. The user with the score at the end of the game wins. The user will be playing against an AI (Artificial Intelligence) player that we will program. The AI will try be more effective/ more successful than the user. There will be a leader-board with all the users' scores and at the end of the client's event a winner will be chosen for a prize.

  \section{Architectural Specifications}
   \subsection{Architectural Requirements}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item (Given to us by the client: eCivix)
        \item Web-based
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The web-based game should be interacted with by users through the web.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Performance
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game must be optimised to function and calculate each decision made by the user in the fastest possible way.
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Privacy 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Legally speaking all information captured by the web-based games registration and login process has to be POPI compliant. The team will be assisted by the legal team of eCivix to ensure that all requirements in terms of privacy are met. 
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Security
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This project will need to be able to keep user data secure and prevent illicit access by third parties. 
            
		\item Scalability 
            		\begin{itemize}
				\item The project is intended for use as an online service, with potentially many different types of game-play and play-throughs. The project should scale as the size of the game itself grows. 
			\end{itemize}

	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    
	    \item Game Theory 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The end game should include mathematical models that simulate the conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision-makers to showcase and represent behavioural patterns of South African voters. In addition, AI players should employ game theory to determine their optimal course of action in any given circumstance.
	    \end{itemize}
   
   \end{itemize}
   \subsection{Quality Requirements} 
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Robustness
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game should have the ability to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input.
	    		
	    \end{itemize}
	    
	    \item Maintainability
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game should be easily maintainable (in good condition), to make future maintenance easier.
         \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
   
  \section{Integration Requirement}
    \subsection{Hardware}
    Minimal hardware requirements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Client/ user side	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A computer with a browser that supports WebGL 
			\item User must have access to the Internet 
		\end{itemize}
		\item Developer side
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A server that can host a database 
			\item A server that can handle high volumes of requests
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
    \subsection{Software}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system will be divided into the following subsystems and components which will communicate with each other via their respective interfaces:

    	\item Authentication  
	    \begin{itemize}
				\item An interface that handles login and register requests from users.
		\end{itemize}

		\item Artificial Intelligence 
   		\begin{itemize}
				\item Users will compete against the computer which is driven by AI. The AI subsystem needs to monitor the user's decisions and also be able to analyze data from the pre-populated database consisting of political data. The AI will use this information to make moves and decisions dynamically.
		\end{itemize}

		\item Users 
		\begin{itemize}
				\item The management of users from the admin side via CRUD methods.   		
		\end{itemize}

		\item Access Module 
		\begin{itemize}

		\end{itemize}

		\item Gameplay
		\begin{itemize}
				\item A subsystem that provides dynamic logic for the game. It consists of the following: user and AI decisions, game rules, political data etc.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Constraints}
		\subsection{Legal constraints}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User information such as emails is sensitive and must be protected. 
				\item A private repository would need to be used if user emails are used to register the users.
			\end{itemize}
